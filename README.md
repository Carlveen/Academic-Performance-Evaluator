**APE (Academic Performance Evaluator)**

APE is a web application designed to empower students to evaluate their academic performances by taking quizzes on various courses they have learned in class. This project aims to provide students with a platform to assess their understanding, identify strengths and weaknesses, and receive valuable feedback to enhance their learning experience.
